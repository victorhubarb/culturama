- **Navigation Menu**: Easy access to key sections of the site including Programming, Categories, and Local Information.
- **Mosaic of Events**: Four prominently displayed images arranged in a mosaic style right below the header, depicting different cultural activities, enhancing visual engagement.
- **Categories Section**: Offers a variety of clickable category buttons for filtering events, alongside a side panel showcasing featured events in a carousel format (visual implementation only).
